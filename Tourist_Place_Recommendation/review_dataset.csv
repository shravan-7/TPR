Every year it is visited by hordes of tourists and locals as it hosts several events like boat racing, kite festival and sand sculptures competitions. Despite a massive footfall, it is one of the cleanest beaches one can come across in the Western coastline of India. The name of the beach has been derived from 'Panam' meaning money and 'ur' meaning place.

It is the first beach in the country which is wholly owned by a private enterprise, i.e. the Panambur Beach Tourism Development Project. The motive is to educate the masses about the efficiency of keeping beaches clean. Owing to its excellent maintenance, the Panambur Beach has been awarded the cleanest and best-maintained beaches in India. Moreover, the beautiful beach is open to several events, promotional programmes, weddings, parties, etc.

The International Kite Festival is organised every two years at the Panambur Beach which is attended by tourists from all across the country. Also, a carnival of more local kite festivals is held at the beach during the last week of April. The beach is an essential landmark to the location of Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers Factory and Kudremukh Iron Ore Factory.","WRP3+QRH, Port Trust Panambur, NH 66, near New Mangalore",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Panamburu+Beach/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x3ba35047685a26f9:0x4a85aeb7baf923ff!8m2!3d12.9369411!4d74.8046043!16s%2Fg%2F11cmycjx_1!19sChIJ-SZaaEdQozsR_yP5ureuhUo?authuser=0&hl=en&rclk=1,"Beautiful clean beach with soft white sand, well maintained that one can enjoy with family and friends.

In Sanskrit, Udu means `star’ and Pa means `leader’. The Chandra is the head of the stars; thus the place came to be known as `Udupi.

The legend has that the Moon God was cursed by Daksh Prajaapati. To redeem himself from this curse, Chandra started worshiping Lord Shiva on the banks of a holy pond, Chandra Pushkarini. Pleased with Chandra, Lord Shiva appeared before him and freed him from the curse. Hence, Shiva came to known as Chandramouleshwara after this event and a temple was built to honor Lord Shiva, which was named as the Chandramouleshwara temple.

There is a tradition of offering oil (in a lit array of lamps) to Lord Chandramouleshwara.

The Chandramouleshwara Temple is built right in front of the Anantheshwara Temple. The temple seems to have been constructed below the ground level, probably, on a lake bed.

This image was replaced by the King Kundvarma of the Alupa dynasty, who was a devotee of Shiva. However it was not the Buddha but a bodhisattva who was historically integrated with Shiva. Historians concluded that the vihara was originally a centre of the cult of the bodhisattva Manjusri. This temple was one of the famous centres of learning and pilgrimage until the 11th century CE. This particular doctrine opened the doors for Tantric religion. Both Shilinga and the bodhisattva were worshipped for many centuries until the Buddhist temple was converted to a purely Saivite temple.

156,"Katthale Basadi, Barkur",Moodahadu,Jain temple,4.5,188,"Steeped in history and architectural intrigue, the Katthale Basadi in Barkur is an ancient Jain temple revered for its intricate craftsmanship.  Built by the Alupa rulers sometime between the 8th and 12th centuries AD, the Basadi stands out for its unique design.  Unlike most South Indian Dravidian temples, Katthale Basadi doesn't feature a towering gopuram, the ornate entrance structure.  Instead, the sanctum sanctorum is enclosed by stone walls and topped with sloping stone pillars.  While the original idol of Mahavira, the 23rd Jain Tirthankara, is no longer present, the Basadi's significance extends to the separate shrines dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, and other Jain deities, reflecting the region's diverse religious heritage.  A visit to Katthale Basadi offers a glimpse into the architectural styles of a bygone era, along with a deeper understanding of Jainism and its peaceful philosophy.","3-22, Acharbettu road, near Garadi, Hosala Village, Barkurpete, Moodahadu, Karnataka 576210","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Katthale+Basadi,+Barkur/@13.4702235,74.7495313,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bbc97bd00000001:0xaffd6f2a86aea480!8m2!3d13.4702183!4d74.7521062!16s%2Fg%2F11c70j0wlg?entry=ttu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
